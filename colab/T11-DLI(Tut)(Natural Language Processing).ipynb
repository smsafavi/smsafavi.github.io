Starting with raw text data, you will preprocess the data by cleaning and transforming it into a usable format. You will then learn to extract meaningful features using techniques like Bag of Words and TF-IDF. With these features, you will train a machine learning model to classify reviews as positive or negative. Finally, you will evaluate your model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and the confusion matrix. By the end of this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience in building a complete NLP pipeline, equipping you with the skills to tackle similar challenges in real-world applications."],"metadata":{"id":"lpSiMwnLZ6z8"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qRRJFi5lXFDr"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importing the libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Mount your Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","# Importing the dataset\n","dataset = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Restaurant_Reviews.tsv', delimiter = '\\t', quoting = 3)\n","\n","dataset"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":442},"id":"6xRO0MOxMSkX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1723383772452,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":66764,"user":{"displayName":"Mostafa Safavi (Dr. Mostafa)","userId":"17694701287426281676"}},"outputId":"abea669b-fc95-4e78-8ff2-bd5f7409db71"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                Review  Liked\n","0                             Wow...
